        <h1>What Makes Me Different?</h1>
        <p>I'm a very hard worker who takes pride in what I do in my day to day life at work. 
          I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many others that you can find in the 
          link in the nav. I program software daily for between six and eight hours. 
          I don't get tired because I'm a machine who doesn't need sleep or food or anything else.</p>

      <h2>Best Buy</h2>
      <p>I worked at bestbuy for six months when I was 16 and 17 years old matching people up with computers they wanted. 
        I'd explain to people about all the pieces of a computer, how it works, what components they should invest more heavily on for gaming. 
        An example of this would be for gaming the GPU, RAM, and CPU are important components. That said, pretty much everything esle in a 
        gaming computer also makes a big difference also. It was a fun place to work that I enjoyed very much but I'd much rather work at a place
        like I do now since it's a remote job if I want it to be and I get to play ping pong whenever I want.  </p>

        <h2>Font Awesome</h2>
        <p>I've worked at Font Awesome since I turned 18. I've loved every second of it and all of the employees in the company. It's between
          a great experience overall and I hope to work here after graduation from Lambda. We play table top games throughout the day when we
          are bored, go out to eat daily, and make our own hours which is a lot of fun and very excitging to me. I'm als able to do the entierty
          of Lambda at my office because they don't mind sharing the office with me. This is a block of text I typed quickly for test purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Side Cars LLC.</h2>
        <p>If you've ever had a nightmare job, this was it. I worked here for six months. They allow drinking heavily on the job, open use
          of drugs at their office, and the CEO is cheating on his wife with the COO of the company. You're also able to play ping pong 
          as much as you want through the day and you can just blame the other people in your department for not getting the work doesn
          that you're actually supposed to have done! They also have parties all the time at the office and have had people get alcohol
          poisoning from it! Again, test paragraph typed quickly for test purposes. Not everything is 100% true.
